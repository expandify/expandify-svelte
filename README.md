# Exportify

This project is in production and may not be stable.

## Project information

This project is a web application to back-up, import and compare your Spotify library.

Inside the `apps` directory are multiple sub-applications. This project combines these applications into one.
Further information on these applications can be found in their individual `README.md`'s.


## Execution

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `apps/exportify_web/assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
